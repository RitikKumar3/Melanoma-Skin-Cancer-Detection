## Melanoma Cancer Detection Using CNN
> We are usiung multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. From 2008 to 2018,
> the annual number of melanoma cases has increased by 53%, partly due to increased UV exposure.
> Although melanoma is one of the most lethal types of skin cancer, a fast diagnosis can lead to a very high chance of survival.

## General Information
- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of
melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.  

## Conclusion
- Improved the accuracy from 55% to 70%.
